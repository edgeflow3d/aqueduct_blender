**We recommend using the Blender addon in conjunction with the [Aqueduct
Desktop App](https://github.com/edgeflow3d/aqueduct).**

**You can get the Aqueduct Desktop app here: [Aqueduct Desktop App Releases](https://github.com/edgeflow3d/aqueduct/releases)**

## How to Use
The addon changes the **context menu that appears when you drag&drop a blendfile onto the blender window.**
It adds its own custom operators at the bottom of the context menu.

The Addon also adds a custom **Pie Menu** with its most used operators to the **Hotkey: Ctrl + Shift + A**
